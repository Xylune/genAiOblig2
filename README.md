# Video Games Sales Analysis Script

⚠️ **Note**: This README and the associated Python script were generated using AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic). While the code has been designed to follow best practices, it's recommended to review and test it thoroughly before use in production environments.

## Overview

This script analyzes video game sales data to uncover trends and patterns in the gaming industry. It generates various visualizations and insights about genre performance, regional preferences, publisher success, and the relationship between critical reception and commercial performance.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.7 or higher
-   A CSV file containing video game sales data with the following columns:
    -   Name
    -   Genre
    -   Publisher
    -   Year_of_Release
    -   Global_Sales
    -   NA_Sales
    -   EU_Sales
    -   JP_Sales
    -   Critic_Score
    -   User_Score

## Installation

1. First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://python.org).

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Place your video games dataset in CSV format in the same directory as the script
2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python analyze_games.py
```

3. The script will:
    - Generate four visualizations in a single figure
    - Print key insights about the data
    - Keep the plots open until you press Enter

## Data Format

Your CSV file should follow this structure:

```
Name,Genre,Publisher,Year_of_Release,Global_Sales,NA_Sales,EU_Sales,JP_Sales,Critic_Score,User_Score
Game1,Action,Publisher1,2010,1.5,0.5,0.4,0.3,75,8.5
Game2,RPG,Publisher2,2011,2.0,0.8,0.6,0.4,85,9.0
...
```

## Output

The script generates:

1. A bar plot showing total sales by genre
2. A heatmap displaying regional market preferences by genre
3. A line plot showing top publishers' performance over time
4. A scatter plot comparing critic scores vs sales

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Missing libraries**:

    - Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`
    - Solution: Run `pip install pandas`

2. **File not found**:

    - Error: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'video_games.csv'`
    - Solution: Ensure your CSV file is in the same directory as the script

3. **Memory issues with large datasets**:
    - Solution: Consider using `chunksize` parameter when reading the CSV:
        ```python
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=10000)
        ```
